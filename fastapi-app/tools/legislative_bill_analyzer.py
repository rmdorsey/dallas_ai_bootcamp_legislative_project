Performs a semantic search for relevant text within a legislative bill.

This is the primary tool to use when you need to find information inside the bill that
answers a user's question or relates to a specific topic. It is ideal for locating
the source text for regulations, definitions, penalties, or requirements before
performing further analysis.

The 'query' should be a descriptive natural language question or topic. For example:
- "What are the rules for data storage and privacy?"
- "clauses related to funding for public schools"
- "the definition of 'eligible contractor'"

Use the optional filters (article_number, section_number) to narrow the search
if the user's request mentions a specific part of the bill.
